# Mess Test - Food Machine

This project contains a very basic implementation of code which allows a user to add food from a redux store and simulate through the UI an API call (loading events).  The page also displays the number of seconds the user is viewing the page.

## What to do.

So we had an externaly company build a piece of code for us, but we need your help to make sure it's of production quality.  We don't need you to actually fix their mistakes, we just would like a code review and for you to mark up as many issues / problems with the code as you see.

We believe in code quality so this isn't about the product but rather your take on what you would expect if someone submitted this code.

## Install dependencies

### `yarn` or `npm install`

## To run the project

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
